## Unit8@AMLD: Engineering for good - detecting pneumonia in X-Ray images

### Content

This repo contains notebooks/data that were using during workshop at Applied Machine Learning Days in Lausanne, split into three branches:

* master -> completed notebook with sample output and all the blank fields filled for you! 
* feature/notebooks-with-exercises -> actual notebooks with excerciess that were presented during 
* feature/best-model -> notebook with model with highest accuracy we achieved after short tuning. Try to beat that and let us know how =]!

### How to run

* Reccomended way is to setup your own python3 virtual environment. You can follow eg. those steps https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.html
* Install necessarry packages ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Run your notebook ```jupyter notebook```


If you just want to skim through what the possible output would be, feel free to checkout to feature/notebook_with_outputs branch and browse the notebooks.
